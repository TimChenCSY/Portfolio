                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Caltec Solution, a small local server management company wishes to refresh its business direction to target young entropeneurs, and streamline the customer acquisition process using their website. </p>
                    <p>Given the short timeframe of the hackathon, we identified the most critical problems and needs, and delivered a comprehensive rebranding proposal along with a new website design tailored for Caltec Solution's unique requirement. I contribute majorly to the user research, problem identification, information design and rebranding. </p>

                        <li>Using various UX methods to identify design targets</li>

                    <h2>Objective Framing </h2>
                    <p>Identify critical problems and offers a tailored solution to help with Caltec Solution's rebranding and customer acquisition process. </p>


                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>Our team undertook comprehensive research on Caltec within the server management sector, including a detailed analysis of the current business model, pain points, interviewing notes, and its competitors. </p>
                    <ul>


                        <li>Lacking previous experience in this field offered us a unique perspective, allowing us to approach the problem from the standpoint of Caltec's customers, focusing on their needs and motivations.</li>

                        <li>We discovered that all of its services, including website maintenance, are managed by the owner of Caltec. This realization profoundly influenced our design approach, guiding us to tailor our solutions to address Caltec's distinct workload and operational requirements.</li>

                        <li>A <strong>User Persona</strong> was built to represent and understand our target clients, playing a crucial role in guiding key decisions. This included shaping the voice and tone, prioritizing information, and steering the overall rebranding strategy, ensuring that every aspect of our design was aligned with the needs and expectations of our primary users.</li>

                        <li>A <strong>User Journey</strong> was created to outline the steps and touchpoints users encounter when seeking Caltec's service, offering a complete view of their experience. This helps in optimizing user flow by providing a holistic understanding from the user's perspective.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Sitemap Building </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We created a sitemap for the existing Caltec website to gain insights into its functions and content. From the view of information architecture, we noted that its navigation, style, and content were outdated. To address this, we overhauled the information architecture and carefully developed a sitemap that aligns with industry standards and is specifically optimized for Caltec's target audiences.
                            The client sees how this new site map can make sense to people with limited IT knowledge and praised it for its clarity.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>Mockups </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Given that "building the site" wasn't included in our final proposal, we intentionally avoided highly customized designs that might be challenging to implement, maintain, or update.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To tailor our design for Caltec, we created a mood board, gathering and analyzing industry's best practices, effective elements, layouts, and styles. This research guided us in developing low-fidelity mockups, eventually leading to the creation of high-fidelity site templates.
                        </li>

                        <li> I designed the home page to start with a clear mission statement, immediately followed by elements utilizing the principle of authority and consensus, followed by a clear breakdown of services in terms that are familiar to the target audience, in a layout that optimizes for scanning. Finally it ends with another call to action to invite further actions.
                        </li>

                        <li>This layout Incorporates several psychological principles that enable Caltec to communicate its core values effectively and transform its website into a powerful tool for customer acquisition.</li>

                        Working with a new team under tight time constraints and diving into a highly specialized industry that was unfamiliar to us presented significant challenges.
