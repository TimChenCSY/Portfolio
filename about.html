                    <h1>Hi</h1>
                    <p class="left-column-description"> My name in Tim Chen, a thrid-year <strong>Interactive Arts and Technology</strong> Student at <strong>SFU</strong> (Simon Fraser University). To describe my experience, it's focused on <strong>UX/UI</strong> Design with a blend of HCI, Product, Game, Writing, Arts, Cinema, Coding and more. (This major is cool)</p>

                    <p class="left-column-description">
                        "With extensive experience, I possess the skills to deeply understand problems and provide creative, multi-faceted solutions. My design process involves a balanced approach of <strong>theoretical and intuitive</strong> justification, resulting in innovative but also practical and functional design that have a sense of "Rightness".

                        With my experience in applying design principles and cognition psychology using design tools such as Adobe Suite and Figma, I’m able to convey messages in graphical mediums to create elegant and delightful products that are caring and detail-oriented.
                        I have experience in developing various user interfaces and promotional graphics through a systematic, iterative design thinking process, from user research to brainstorming, wireframing and creating High-fidelity interactive prototypes. </p>
                    <p class="left-column-description">
                        I’m also taking the “**Innovation and Entrepreneurship Certificate**” at SFU Charles Chang Institute. This program granted me the experience of working in a multi-discipline team with real startups in Vancouver to explore Product-Market-fit, Project management, Pitching and generally the business side of a product. This experience allows me to evaluate designs from multiple perspective.</p>
                    <p class="left-column-description">
                        As a passionate lifelong learner, I am always curious about new technology and ideas while open to new challenges.During my spare time, I read design books and articles for inspiration. I gather creative sparks from everyday observations and envision how they can be transformed into a startup company.

                        As the tech person in my home, I am responsible for fixing any tech problems that arise. I always stay up-to-date with the latest tech trends and innovations. (Note: Although this portfolio was not generated using chatGPT.) </p>
