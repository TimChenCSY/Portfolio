                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>We designed a poster and a microsite for MAXXI museum to capture the experience of <strong>"Superstudio 50"</strong>, the Superstudio 50 years anniversary event. Superstudio is one of the most influential Italian radical architecture groups. MAXXI (National Museum of 21st Century Art) is the national museum of Contemporary Art and Architecture, located in Rome, Italy.</p>
                    <p>Starting from graphic exploration, we focused on expressing the "experimental" feeling of Superstudio using the perspective grid element.</p>
                </div>

                <div class=case-contentblock>
                    <h2>Project Information</h2>
                    <p>This is the final project for my <strong>Information Design</strong> course IAT235, taught by Russell Taylor</p>
                    <p> We were assigned to design an poster and a <strong>microsite</strong> about SuperStudio 50 Exhibition in MAXXI Museum. </p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Objective Framing </h2>
                    <p>Build a microsite for SuperStudio that helps past attendees to re-live the SuperStudio 50-years anniversary exhibition again. </p>


                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>To capture the essence of SuperStudio, I studied the works and philosophies SuperStudio is trying to deliver. I read their articles, interviews, speeches and reviews, and come up with the following insights. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Radical, Experimental, Critical, Surrealistic. </li>
                        <li>Use of Perspective grid as the fundemental "essential element". </li>
                        <li>Rejection of traditions and contemporary values</li>
                        <li> The Four most representitive Project: Superstudio Migrazioni, Superstudio Monumento Continuo, Superstudio 50 AttiFondamentali Vita and Superstudio 50 exhibition at Maxxi Museum </li>

                <div class=case-contentblock>
                    <h2>Start: Poster Explorations</h2>
                    <p>With the insights, I started to experiment with grids, architecture, color and halftone effect from SuperStudio's works, and typography. We provide internal critiques for each other during creating our own sets of posters. (Poster shown here are all created by me)

                    </p>

                    <figure class=case-fig>
                        <img src="imgs/SuperstudioPoster1.JPG" alt=" Poster iterations">
                        <figcaption>Iterations in week 1-2</figcaption>

                    </figure>

                    <p>I think the 3d approach was very interesting and had a lot of potential, and tried to push it more. Unfortunately, the product did not meet my expectation. However, during exploring 3d shapes, I found that I was following SuperStudio's design philosophy by reducing elements to simple blocks. I continued to follow this method and make letters from the "essential blocks" I made.
                    </p>

                    <figure class=case-fig>
                        <img src="imgs/SuperstudioPoster2.JPG" alt="Poster iterations">
                        <figcaption>Iteration on week 3</figcaption>

                    </figure>



                    <figure class=case-fig>
                        <img src="imgs/SuperstudioPoster3.JPG" alt="Poster iterations">
                        <figcaption>The first poster and the Final Poster.</figcaption>

                    </figure>


                    <p>All the elements, colors, and even creating methods in these posters are heavily inspired by SuperStudio’s ideology. I think they successfully captured the feeling of "Experimental" and "Radical". </p>


                </div>


                <div class=case-contentblock>
                    <h2>Microsite Animation</h2>
                    <p>After poster creation, we were asked to develop a microsite to recreate the SuperStudio50 experience.</p>

                    <figure class=case-fig>
                        <img src="imgs/Superstudiogif1.gif" alt="Final UIs">
                        <figcaption>The landing animation.</figcaption>

                    </figure>


                    <h2>Storytelling methods</h2>
                    <p>Limited by the power of the Figma prototype, a lot of advanced web design story telling ideas can't be achieved. Several attempts to recreate 3d models in Figma did not work as expected.</p>

                    <figure class=case-fig>
                        <img src="imgs/SSgif4.gif" alt="final GIF">
                        <figcaption>My attempt to create a "archive drawer" experience using smart animate in Figma, But it was too much for Figma to handle.</figcaption>

                    </figure>

                    <p>Although limited by Figma’s animating power. I conveyed the feeling of the “SuperStudio experience”, the “experimental, conceptual and ahead-of-it’s-time” experience using "go back in time" year-counts.</p>

                    <h2>When scrolled down</h2>
                    <figure class=case-fig>
                        <img src="imgs/Superstudiogif2.gif" alt="final GIF">

                    </figure>
                    <figure class=case-fig>
                        <img src="imgs/Superstudiogif3.gif" alt="final GIF">
                        <figcaption>My attempt to create a "archieve drawer" experience using smart animate in Figma, But it was too much for Figma to handle.</figcaption>

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Both pages used perspective shifts and animation to give a dynamic feeling.
                        The works are arranged in Chronological order to show the progression of SuperStudio’s architecture ideology.</p>

                    <h2>Achievement</h2>
                    <p>This project Received a prasied A- Grade from our professor Russell Taylor.</p>
